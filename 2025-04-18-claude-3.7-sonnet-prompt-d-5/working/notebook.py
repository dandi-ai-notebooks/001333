# # Exploring Dandiset 001333: Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD)
#
# **⚠️ Important Notice:** This notebook was AI-generated using dandi-notebook-gen and has not been fully verified. Please be cautious when interpreting the code or results.
#
# ## Overview
#
# The Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD) contains electrophysiological signals from both healthy and parkinsonian subjects. The dataset includes two types of signals from each group:
# 
# 1. **Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV)**: Determined by calculating the Average Rectified Value of the beta band, achieved by fully rectifying the filtered LFP signal using a fourth-order Chebyshev band-pass filter with an 8 Hz bandwidth, centered around the peak of the LFP power spectrum.
# 
# 2. **Local Field Potential (LFP)**: Derived from the synchronized activity of neuron populations between the cortex, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and thalamus.
#
# The parkinsonian signals typically show a relatively high power density at the beta frequency (13 to 30 Hz). These beta oscillations in the STN are commonly used as pathological biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms.
#

# ## Discussion and Interpretation
#
# ### Key Findings
#
# 1. **Data Structure**: The PESD dataset contains electrophysiological recordings from simulated healthy subjects, organized with multiple electrodes and shanks.
#
# 2. **Beta Band Activity**: The analysis of beta band voltage from the healthy simulated subject shows a typical 1/f spectral pattern, with power decreasing as frequency increases. The beta band (13-30 Hz) shows low power relative to lower frequencies, which is consistent with expectations for healthy subjects.
#
# 3. **Session Characteristics**: Our analysis revealed that the different sessions in this subset of the dataset contain identical data, which explains the perfect correlation between sessions. This suggests that the files may be duplicates or generated from the same simulation parameters. This finding highlights the importance of verifying data uniqueness when working with simulated datasets.
#
# ### Significance
#
# This dataset is valuable for studying Parkinson's Disease biomarkers, particularly beta oscillations in the STN. The simulated data provides a controlled environment for developing analysis methods and testing hypotheses about PD-related electrophysiological patterns.
#
# ### Limitations
#
# The data we've examined is from simulated healthy subjects only. A comprehensive analysis would include comparison with parkinsonian subjects to observe the differences in beta band activity that serve as PD biomarkers.
#
# ## Future Directions
#
# Future analyses could include:
#
# 1. Comparing healthy subjects with parkinsonian subjects to identify key differences in beta band activity
# 2. Applying advanced signal processing techniques to extract more subtle features from the LFP signals
# 3. Developing classification algorithms that could automatically distinguish between healthy and parkinsonian signals
# 4. Correlating beta band power with clinical measures of PD severity
# 5. Investigating the relationship between beta ARV and raw LFP signals to better understand how these metrics relate to neural activity
#
# This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems and other therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's Disease.
