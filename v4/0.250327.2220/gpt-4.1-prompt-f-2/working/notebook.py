# ## Overview
#
# This notebook provides an introduction and exploratory analysis for [Dandiset 001333 (Version 0.250327.2220)](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001333/0.250327.2220):  
# **"Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD)"**
#
# PESD contains electrophysiological signals from both healthy and Parkinsonian subjects, modeled and simulated to study neural activity in relevant brain structures.  
#
# **Dataset citation:**

# ### About the Dataset
# - Signals include **Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV)** and **Local Field Potential (LFP)** from the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
# - **Beta ARV:** Calculated by rectifying beta-band LFP after filtering; used as a biomarker for Parkinson's symptoms.
# - **LFP:** Reflects local population neural activity.
# - The dataset includes electrode metadata and multiple simulated sessions.

# ## Required Packages
# This notebook assumes the following Python packages are already installed:
# - numpy
# - pandas
# - matplotlib
# - pynwb
# - h5py
# - remfile
# - dandi (for the DANDI API)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Listing Assets in the Dandiset

# %%
from itertools import islice
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient

# Connect to DANDI archive
client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset("001333", "0.250327.2220")

# Print basic information about the Dandiset
metadata = dandiset.get_raw_metadata()
print(f"Dandiset name: {metadata['name']}")
print(f"Dandiset URL: {metadata['url']}")

# List some assets in the Dandiset
assets = dandiset.get_assets()
print("\nFirst 5 assets:")
for asset in islice(assets, 5):
    print(f"- {asset.path} (ID: {asset.identifier})")

# ## Loading and Exploring an Example NWB File
#
# We'll focus on the NWB file:
#
# ```
# sub-healthy-simulated-beta/sub-healthy-simulated-beta_ses-162_ecephys.nwb
# ```
# URL: [Direct download link](https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/b344c8b7-422f-46bb-b016-b47dc1e87c65/download/)
#
# [üåê View this file in Neurosift](https://neurosift.app/nwb?url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/b344c8b7-422f-46bb-b016-b47dc1e87c65/download/&dandisetId=001333&dandisetVersion=draft)
#
# Below is the approach for streaming and reading this remote NWB file.

# %%
import pynwb
import h5py
import remfile

# Load file from remote DANDI asset URL
url = "https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/b344c8b7-422f-46bb-b016-b47dc1e87c65/download/"
remote_file = remfile.File(url)
h5_file = h5py.File(remote_file)
io = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file)
nwb = io.read()

print("NWB File loaded successfully.")
print("Session description:", nwb.session_description)
print("Identifier:", nwb.identifier)
print("Start time:", nwb.session_start_time)
print("File create date(s):", nwb.file_create_date)

# %% [markdown]
# Let's summarize the NWB file structure and key info:
#
# **Subject:** healthy-simulated-beta (species: Homo sapiens, [simulated])  
# **Lab:** BrainX Lab, Michigan Technological University  
# **Signals:** Processed Beta Band Voltage (ARV, volts) from multiple simulated electrodes  
# **Electrodes:** Grouped into 4 shanks (shank0 - shank3), 3 electrodes per shank  
# **Processing Modules:**  
#   - `ecephys`: Contains `LFP` with `Beta_Band_Voltage` ElectricalSeries  
#
# | Key | Description |
# |-----|-------------|
# | nwb.processing["ecephys"] | Processed electrophysiology |
# | LFP | Local Field Potential container |
# | Beta_Band_Voltage | Main processed signal (ARV) |
#
# For more on metadata structure, see NWB documentation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Electrode Table Overview
#
# Let's view the electrode metadata (id, location, group, group_name, label):

# %%
import pandas as pd

electrodes_df = nwb.electrodes.to_dataframe()
display(electrodes_df)

# %% [markdown]
# This table shows 12 electrodes across 4 simulated shanks (`shank0`‚Äì`shank3`). All are registered as 'Simulated Cortico-basal-ganglia network of brain'.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Visualizing Beta Band Voltage Signal
# 
# We now visualize the main processed signal ‚Äî Beta Band Voltage ‚Äî as a time series and as a distribution.
# The signal units are volts. There are 1400 time samples in this recording.

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

beta = nwb.processing["ecephys"].data_interfaces["LFP"].electrical_series["Beta_Band_Voltage"]
data = beta.data[:]
timestamps = beta.timestamps[:]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(timestamps, data, color="tab:blue", lw=1)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Beta Band Voltage (V)")
plt.title("Beta Band Voltage vs. Time")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(f"Data mean: {np.mean(data):.6f}, std: {np.std(data):.6f}, min: {np.min(data):.6f}, max: {np.max(data):.6f}")

# %% [markdown]
# This shows oscillatory activity in the beta band; peak-to-peak voltage is in the range ~0 to 0.00014 V.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Signal Distribution

# %%
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.hist(data, bins=40, color='tab:purple', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel("Beta Band Voltage (V)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Beta Band Voltage Signal Histogram")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# The histogram shows a right-skewed unimodal distribution, with most values clustered near 0.00004 V and a gradual decline at higher voltages.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Summary and Future Directions
#
# This notebook demonstrated how to:
# - Access and browse a Dandiset using the DANDI API
# - Load remote NWB files in Python (no file download required)
# - Explore key metadata and structure
# - Visualize main processed signals both time-domain and distributionally
# - Summarize electrode metadata
#
# Possible extensions:
# - Analyze and visualize other sessions or compare across subjects/groups
# - Explore additional signals or raw LFP if available
# - Extract time-frequency features or spectral content per electrode
# - Statistical comparison of healthy vs. Parkinsonian simulated groups
#
# For in-depth questions, consult the original dataset paper or use interactive platforms such as [Neurosift](https://neurosift.app) for further data exploration.
